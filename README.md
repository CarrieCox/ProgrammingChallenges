# PMG Programming Challenge

This repository contains files used for a SQL technical assessment for a job position's interview process. This assessment consisted of using SQL to derive insights on various marketing campaigns and how well they are performing. All the queries only required basic commands in SQL, however I did choose to use a CTE for the last problem in order to show more advanced skills.

## Language Used

This role primarily uses data visualization platforms and SQL. So this assessment was completed using SQL in Oracle APEX.

## Result of Assessment

I was moved along in the interview process after this assessment. The next step was a technical interivew where I explained my code from this repository.

## Files

Within the sql-assessment folder, there are 5 files. The README.md file has all of the questions written out and was provided by the hiring company. There are three csv files that I uploaded into Oracle Apex to query from. The SQL Assessment PMG.sql file contains the questions from this assessment as well as my queries.
