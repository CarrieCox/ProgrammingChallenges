# PMG Programming Challenges

This repository contains files used for a SQL technical assessment for a job position's interview process. This assessment consisted of using SQL to derive insights on various marketing campaigns and how well they are performing. All the queries only required basic commands in SQL, however I did choose to use a CTE for the last problem in order to show more advanced skills.

## Language Used

This role primarily uses data visualization platforms and SQL. So this assessment was completed using SQL in Oracle APEX.

## Result of Assessment

I was moved along in the interview process after this assessment. The next step was a technical interivew where I explained my code from this repository.
